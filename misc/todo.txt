Todo:
- Disable "Secure Channel" item as soon as disable code is received
- Only enable "Secure Channel" item when app is connected
- Display SHA, MD5 as HexDigits (f9:de:0f etc...)
- Make events for stages (generate 1st half, etc...) of channel securing (display as Modal dialog?)
- Allow choice of algorithms and strength? ElGamal or DH instead of RSA???
- Choose save location for keys, encocrypted/decrupted files

Leave for now:
- Allow choice of provider (how to handle
	java.security.Security.addProvider(new au.net.aba.crypto.provider.ABAProvider());
	call)
	Too hard given provider specific code
- Add new entry point for different provider installs (java.security vs policy file)
	Too hard given provider specific code
- Change storage/loading of keys to use raw bytes rather than objects (can't load RSA as bytes)
	ABA doesn't allow it. Serialization of keys doesn't work due to serialVersionUID
	problems. Stored modolus and exponent BigIntegers instead.
