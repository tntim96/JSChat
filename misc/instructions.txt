JSChat is an internet utility that allows you to \"text\" chat and send files securely across the internet.

To connect to a friend you must both be connected to the internet. You must also decide who is to select \"Network\">\"Listen for a connection\" and who is to select \"Network\">\"Connect to Server\". Whoever selects \"Network\">\"Connect to Server\" must first select \"Setup\">\"Connect IP Address\" and set the \"Connect IP Address\" to the IP address of the other person.

To prepare for an encrypted conversation:
1)Person A and B select \"Crypt\">\"Generate Assymetric Keys\"
2)Person A and B give each other their public keys

The typical series of events to set-up a connection are:
1)Arrange a time for you and your friend to connect to the Internet
2)Person A selects \"Utilties\">\"Obtain your IP Address\"
3)Person A then emails his/her IP Address to person B
4)Person A then selects \"Network\">\"Listen for Connection\"
5)Person B then reads the email and sets the \"Connect IP Address\" address by selecting \"Setup\">\"Connect IP Address\"
6)Person B then selects \"Network\">\"Connect to Server\"

To secure the channel:
1)Person A and B select \"Crypt\">\"Load Private Key\"
2)Each person selects their own private key
3)Person A and B select \"Crypt\">\"Load Public Key\"
4)Each person selects the other's public key
5)Person A or B selects \"Crypt\">\"Secure Channel\"

To send a file:
1)Person A selects \"Utilities\">\"Send a File\" then select a file to send
2)Person B will see a save dialog to save the file

If the file transfer is interrupted or cancelled, you can resume the file transfer:
1)Person A selects \"Utilities\">\"Send a File\", then selects the file to resume sending
2)Person B will see a save dialog and should select the original file from the first file transfer.

To compare large files on different computers (e.g. after sending a file)
1)Person A selects \"File Integrity\">\"CRC32\" then select the file
2)Person B selects \"File Integrity\">\"CRC32\" then select the same file on his/her system
3)Person A and B can then compare the CRC32 value - if the CRC32 values are the same the files should be the same
4)To improve the comparison Person A and B can agree on a different seed and generate a new CRC32 value by selecting \"File Integrity\">\"SEED\" and entering the new seed. The seed can consist of 8 Hex digits (characters between 0-9 and a-f). Person A and B then follow steps 1 to 3.

When using JSChat for long periods, JSChat may be set to run in the background. To regain the other users attention, select \"Utilities\">\"Wake Remote User\". This will cause the remote user's computer to beep, and also bring JSChat to the foreground of their screen.
